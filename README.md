# Goblin Game

This is a small (some might say "goblin sized") game, created as proof of concept for a larger project's combat system.

You play as a goblin and fight enemies in a multi-stage card game.
It's neither fun nor engaging but the game this will eventually be a part of will be, hopefully.
